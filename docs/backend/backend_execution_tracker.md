# iVendorz — Backend Execution Tracker

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Document type** | Living execution tracker · non-authoritative under the frozen corpus |
| **Companion to** | [`backend_build_plan.md`](backend_build_plan.md) (sequence) · [`backend_execution_playbook.md`](backend_execution_playbook.md) (how-to-build) |
| **Updated** | 2026-07-08 |
| **Rule** | Coins nothing. Tracks status only; on any conflict the frozen corpus + the Build Plan win. |

> Live per-work-package status board for the backend build — the backend analog of
> `project-management/execution-board.md`. **One module scope per PR; multiple WP PRs per module.**
> A WP advances only through its full lifecycle (Build Plan §6); it closes at
> `BLOCKER = MAJOR = MINOR = 0` with its required Doc-8 bands green.

## Status legend

| Mark | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ⬜ | Planned — not started (DoR may still be open) |
| 🔍 | Discovery — WP card + grounding in progress |
| 🟡 | In Progress — building |
| 🔵A | Review-A (architecture & governance, fresh context) |
| 🔵B | Review-B (quality & adversarial, fresh context) |
| 🟣 | Board / owner adjudication (Validate-Findings §13) |
| ✅ | Merged into `wave/2-core-platform` |
| ⛔ | Blocked (open dependency or `[ESC-*]`) |

> **Additive amendment — execution-organization sync (2026-07-09).** Rows advance under the
> **AI Engineering Organization v1.0** (`project-management/ai-engineering-organization-plan.md` ·
> `governanceReviews/BOARD-DECISION-AI-ENG-ORG_v1.0.md`). **Team-6 (Security Review) activates per
> the ratified runtime policy** on any security-surfaced WP — it may run **alongside** 🔵B on the
> same SHA; its verdict is required before 🟣 for those rows and is logged in the same RV entry; non-surfaced rows record "N/A" without
> activation (charter: `governanceReviews/TEAM-6-Security-Review-Charter.md`). Legend unchanged;
> governance not restated here.

**Wave-2 gate on close of all rows:** Wave Integration Audit GREEN → one PR `wave/2-core-platform → main` → *Core Platform gated* (Build_Roadmap §9 milestone 3).

## Wave 2 — Core Platform (M0 → M1, serial)

### Stage A — M0 `core` (infra-only shape-exception)

| **W2-CORE-3** | M0 conformance gate (CR4′ immutability + outbox observer green) | CORE-2 ✅ | ✅ | **PASS** (RV-0145, combined A+B Lane-L) | **PASS** (same activation; trigger-disable discrimination probe + double-run) | (checkpoint on wave branch) | `f2c9c95` · close `654368f` | 8D ✅ (19 new) · 8B cited · 120/17 | `[D-5]` on Board channel | **✅ clean-gate close 2026-07-09 — M0 STAGE A COMPLETE; M0 Wave-2 module DoD MET** (18 keys ✓ · 8D ✓ · 8B ✓ · BAC ✓ · README absent noted); sub-gating carry: NIT-1 comment + OBS-2 fixture-prefix → next M0-adjacent checkpoint |

| WP-1.9 infra (Supabase + Vercel + push `main` + branch-protection) | Board-parked | ⛔ external — suites run locally until unparked (Build Plan §3) |
